# by default some intel compilers put temporaries on the stack
# this might lead to segmentation faults if the stack limit is set to low
# stack limits can be increased by sysadmins or e.g with ulimit -s 256000
# furthermore new ifort (tested to work fine with 10.0.025) compilers support the option
# -heap-arrays 64
# add this to the compilation flags if the other options do not work
# Tested on a HP Integrity rx4640 SMP machine with 4 Itanium2 (1.5 GHz)
# The Intel Fortran compiler version 8.0 did not work,
# but version 7.1 worked for the arguments below.
# Note: -O2 produces an executable which is slightly faster than -O3
# and the compilation time was also much shorter.
