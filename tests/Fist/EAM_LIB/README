The potentials for Ag, Pt and Au listed here are converted from the LAMMPS distribution 
(http://lammps.sandia.gov). The mixed file is generated by multiplication of Za(R)*Zb(R)/R 
as prescribed in Foiles et al., PRB 33 (1986) 7983. Note that the grid is quite loose, so 
EMAX_SPLINE is set to a high value (D. Passerone).
