This directory should contain a number of testcases that can be used 
to check that a given feature remains in a working state, and that 
e.g. bugs do not reappear. The idea is that all inputs in this directory 
will be executed from time to time automatically and that results will be
compared to older data.

As we should have *many* tests here, I would like them to be fast (e.g. less than 1min. 
on a normal pc with an sdbg version of the code). Since these tests do not need to return
meaningful results (just consistent results), one can use e.g. small basis sets, low cutoffs,
small EPS_DEFAULT, ...

Adding a test is very simple. Commit the .inp and add an entry to TEST_FILES. These files 
will be run in order, so that a job that wants a restart is no problem.
