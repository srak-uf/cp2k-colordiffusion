#
# a quite general derivative free approach to minimize stuff.
# basically scriptmini.f90 will compile into an executable which will
# minimize the script called scriptmini_eval
# communication between scriptmini.x and scriptmini_eval is through two files
# scriptmini_eval.in and scriptmini_eval.out
# the former contains the variables at which scriptmini_eval should evaluate the objective function
# while the later should contain the value of the objective function at these variables
#
# The 2 line how to goes as :
#
gfortran -O2 -o scriptmini.x scriptmini.f90
./scriptmini.x < scriptmini.in
